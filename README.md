# Mapping_Earthquakes - Module 13 Challenge - GeoJSON and Leaflet

## Overview of the Analysis

The purpose of this analysis is to create an earthquake map that plot magnitude and tectonic plates. This uses the leaflet system with Mapbox basemaps in order to show the magnitudes against the locations of techtonic plates, as well as highlighting the higher magnitude hearthquakes in a different layer.

## Resources Used
- Software: SQLAlchemy 1.4.27, Python 3.7.6, Visual Studio Code 1.63.2, D3.js library, Leaflet, MapBox

## Results

The results can be shown by downloading the Earthquake_Challenge folder. Earthquakes with a magnitude of 6.0 or higher are shown in a dark red, and tectonic plates are drawn with a pink line. A street, satellite and dark map view can be used to show the data.

Future improvements can be made to account for the addition of the Major Earthquake data and Tectonic Plates to the legend, which currently does not indicate their data. As well, the normal earthquake layer can draw over the major earthquake layer if it is deactivated then reactivated.
